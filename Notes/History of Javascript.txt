History of javascript

JavaScript was created in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, who was working at Netscape Communications Corporation at the time. 
Originally called Mocha, the language was later renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript.

The development of JavaScript was partly driven by the desire to add interactivity and dynamic content to websites. 
At the time, web pages were mostly static and consisted of plain HTML, with very limited interactivity. 
Netscape saw an opportunity to add scripting capabilities to their web browser, which would allow developers to write programs that 
  could interact with the web page and the user.

JavaScript was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995, and quickly gained popularity as a tool for creating interactive 
  web pages. However, the early versions of JavaScript were not very standardized, and different web browsers implemented the language in 
  slightly different ways, which made it difficult for developers to write code that would work consistently across all platforms.

To address these issues, a group of companies including Netscape, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems formed the ECMAScript working group in 1996. 
The goal of the group was to create a standardized version of JavaScript, which would be implemented consistently across all web browsers.

In June 1997, the first version of the ECMAScript specification was released, which defined the core features of the language, including variables,
  functions, and control structures. Since then, several new versions of the specification have been released, each adding new features and 
  functionality to the language.

Today, JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and is widely used for both client-side and server-side 
  development. The language has evolved significantly since its creation, and continues to be developed and improved by the ECMAScript 
  working group and the broader JavaScript community.
